# Pima-Indian-Diabetes-Prediction

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Using the particular database, I have predicted the outcome using Boosting and Stacking technique.  

Note : My next work will be on Malaria Dataset. My aim is to work on atleaat 5 disease dataset and then I will be creating Web app using Flask where user can check whether they are suffering from those diseases or not. After completing the web app, I will deploy it on Heroku and code can be accessed from GitHub.
